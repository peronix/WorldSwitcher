# World Switcher

This plugin will automatically select a world from the World Visit menu when a hunt is reported by [Sonar](https://img.shields.io/badge/Use%20This%20Template-0?logo=github&labelColor=grey) in the chat window.

Best used in conjunction with [YesAlready](https://github.com/PunishXIV/YesAlready) to bypass the confirmation prompt.
