# World Switcher

This plugin will automatically select a world from the World Visit menu when a hunt is reported by [Sonar](https://github.com/FFXIV-Sonar/SonarDistrib) in the chat window.

Best used in conjunction with [YesAlready](https://github.com/PunishXIV/YesAlready) to bypass the confirmation prompt.
